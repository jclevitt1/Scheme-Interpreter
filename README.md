# Scheme-Interpreter

Recreates a interpreter of the Scheme language using both Python and Scheme.

The interpreter works in the following manner:

Read- the input is read and broken up into different tokens of operators, key words, and operands.

Evaluate and Apply- the tokens are evaluated through mutually recursive functions scheme_eval and scheme_apply.
